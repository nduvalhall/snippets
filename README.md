# Snippets
Snippets is a project designed to capture code snippets that can be trusted and 
can be used in enterprise software.

## Problem
The problem this project is aiming to solve is that AI models cannot be trusted to
produce correct results for general algorithms - even if they give the correct
solution now, this could change over time.

## Solution
The solution to this is to collect code snippets by human beings that can be voted
on by users to ensure collective assurance that some code solves the problem posed.
